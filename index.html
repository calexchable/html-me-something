                <h3>Little Pillow Skateboard</h3>
                <p>When you press the star on the bottom, it goes really comfy. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="lamby">
                    <img src="lamby-lamb.JPG" alt="Lamb kin lovie sits on the couch" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Lamby</h3>
                <p>He is a super comfortable little lamb. He is just a head and arms. And a little blanket</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="legos">
                    <img src="legos.JPG" alt="Lego Toys set up for some kind of thunderdome battle of some kind" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Box of Legos</h3>
                <p>Okay, box of Legos is like an army because it's just a box with a whole bunch of Lego people. You can also pretend that the Lego people are building and are really fast, or they are controlling themselves like a building.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="couch">
                    <img src="orange-couch.JPG" alt="Big Orange Ikea couch that folds into a bed" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Big Couch</h3>
                <p>Big couch can get the legos because when you unfold it it becomes a big bed-like couch. If you do a battle between the legos and the couch, the couch will often win.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="totem">
                    <img src="totem-pole.JPG" alt="Pewter Totem Pole from the Seattle airport" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Small Totem Pole</h3>
                <p>Small Totem Pole is cool because it can bomb into legos or into the couch; it's almost as big as the couch, but is really almost as big as me. And it can, actually, fire itself back at the person or thing that it's battling. So, that's the cool part.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="satchel">
                    <img src="purple-bag.JPG" alt="Photograph of purple satchel" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Picture of a little back pack</h3>
                <p>So the picture of a little back pack is really cool because it can print itself as a little back pack and launch itself against its opponents. It would probably lose against the totem pole, becuase the totem pole is mostly cedar bark.</p>

            <h3>About Tavi:</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Tavi. All things you heard about in the upper words are mostly about the things I like the most. So to know me better, my name is Tavi Chable&#769;. I'm not the kind of the person that likes fight, even though I said a lot of stuff about battles. I only like air fighting. Air fighting is kind of annoying because you can block people with air who are fighting you. And they're annoying because you just blow out energy, and people don't get hurt. It's energy exercise. That's all I want to say about me, maybe. Maybe I don't have to be like the things you like, but maybe we can just like the pictures. But Do What You Do.</p>
