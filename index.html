                <h3>Little Pillow Skateboard</h3>
                <p>When you press the star on the bottom,
                    <br>it goes really comfy. </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="lamby">
                    <img src="" alt="Lamb kin lovie sits on the couch" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Lamby</h3>
                <p>He is a super comfortable little lamb.
                    <br>He is just a head and arms. And a little
                    <br>blanket</p>
            </div>
            <div>

                    <img src="" alt="Lego Toys set up for some kind of thunderdome battle of some kind" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Box of Legos</h3>
                <p>Okay, box of Legos is like an army because
                    <br>it's just a box with a whole bunch of Lego
                    <br>people. You can also pretend that the Lego
                    <br>people are building and a really fast, or
                    <br>they are controlling themselves like a building.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="couch">
                    <img src="" alt="Big Orange Ikea couch that folds into a bed" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Big Couch</h3>
                <p>Big couch can get the legos because when
                        <br>you unfold it it becomes a big bed like
                        <br>couch. If you do a battle between the
                        <br>legos and the couch, the couch with often
                        <br>win.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <a name="totem">
                    <img src="" alt="Pewter Totem Pole from the Seattle airport" width="240" />
                </a>
                <h3>Small Totem Pole</h3>
                <p>Small Totem Pole is cool because it can
                        <br>bomb into legos or into the couch, it's
                        <br>almost as big as the couch, but is really
                        <br>almost as big as me. But it can actually
                        <br>fire itself back at the person or thing
                        <br>that it's battling. So that's the cool
                        <br>part.</p>

                </a>
                <h3>Picture of a little back pack</h3>
                <p>So the picture of a little back pack is
                        <br>really cool because it can print itself
                        <br>as a little back pack and launch itself
                        <br>against its oppents. It would probably
                        <br>lose against the totem pole, becuase the
                        <br>totem pole is mostly cedar bark.</p>

            <h3>About Tavi:</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Tavi. All things you heard about in the
                    <br>upper words are mostly about the things I like
                    <br>the most. So to know me better my name is Tavi Chable&#769;.
                    <br>I'm not the kind of the person that likes fight,
                    <br>even though I said a lot of stuff about battles.
                    <br>I only like air fighting. Air fighting is kind of
                    <br>annoying because you can block people with air who
                    <br>are fighting you. And they're annoying becuase you
                    <br>just blow out energy and people don't get hurt.
                    <br>It's energy exercises. That's all I want to say
                    <br>about me maybe. Maybe I don't have to be like the
                    <br>things you like, but maybe we can just like the
                    <br>pictures. The maze is never finished. It would be
                    <br>a lot of contact. But Do What You Do.</p>
